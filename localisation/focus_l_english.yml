 DEN_housingcrisis:0 "The Housing Crisis"
 DEN_housingcrisis_desc:0 "Since the end of the second world war people have been moving from the countryside to the cities in larger and larger numbers, this, alongside the existing companies selfish inaction, has resulted in a housing shortage which has now evolved into a housing crisis. That we need to fix this is obvious, but how?"
 DEN_housingcrisisa:0 "Helping Hand Of The State"
 DEN_housingcrisisa_desc:0 "The state sector will handle this crisis, it's far too important to be left to the greedy fatcats. Together we will make affordable and comfortable housing available for the everyday man."
 DEN_housingcrisisb:0 "Invisible Hand Of The Market"
 DEN_housingcrisisb_desc:0 "We shall allow new and eager private contractors access to the pereferies of our cities, they will quickly make housing avilable to the masses, and dont worry about prices, the market will eventually regualte itself. We promise..."
 DEN_housingcrisisa2:0 "Consult The Folketing"
 DEN_housingcrisisa2_desc:0 "Before we can venture out on this grand enterprise we need to consult our parliament to secure their support. A few laws will need to be passed, but with our current majority that really shouldnt be a problem."
 DEN_housingcrisisa3:0 "Consult The Unions"
 DEN_housingcrisisa3_desc:0 "It would be wise to also consult the unions, both construction and architectural, if we want this to be a truly popular effort. Besides, the more left wing parts of our parliament demand it of us."
 DEN_housingcrisisa4:0 "The Planners Plan"
 DEN_housingcrisisa4_desc:0 "The urban planners will need to get to work on the expansion of our towns into cities, and our cities into megalopolises, the buildings we build today will be the neighboorhoods and communities of tomorrow. Thats why we must give them time to perfect this plan, or we may have problems down the road."
 DEN_housingcrisisa5:0 "Expand The Five Fingers"
 DEN_housingcrisisa5_desc:0 "The 'five finger plan' was originally conceived in 1949 as a long term plan for the expansion of our capital, København. The 'fingers' consist of area designated for urban development, with farmlands and forests going between them dedicated for recreation. "
 DEN_housingcrisisa6:0 "Sell the Houses"
 DEN_housingcrisisa6_desc:0 "The Socialist People's party counter this by claiming that it would effectively make the state one giant landlord. They instead propose that we should sell people the houses at a low and affortable rate always adjusted for inflation, and only being able to be sold back to the state. But unlike the other plan this wouldn't add a flowing stream of money to the state, so the material pros may outweigh the idealistic cons."
 DEN_housingcrisisa7:0 "Rent The Houses"
 DEN_housingcrisisa7_desc:0 "Parliamentary discussions have now shifted to the issue of how to actually get the houses to the people, the right wing parts of our coalition wants us to rent out the housing. They claim that this will, among other things, add a new steady income to the state budget."
 DEN_housingcrisisdone:0 "Done By 71'"
 DEN_housingcrisisdone_desc:0 "500.000 homes in 7 years is highly ambitious, but also highly necessary. We will build them fast, for if we dont economic potential will surely be wasted."
 DEN_housingcrisisb2a:0 "Allow Jeudan A/S To Start Construction"
 DEN_housingcrisisb2a_desc:0 "Jeudan A/S has been designing and building houses in Denmark since 1898, so it only seems natural that they should also be the ones to take us out of this crisis. They propose low-density-residential neighboorhoods on the outsskirts of the cities as the solution."

 DEN_housingcrisisb4a:0 "'Lige Ud Af Landevejen'"
