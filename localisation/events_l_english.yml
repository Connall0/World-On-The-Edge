 ##ITALY
  ita.1.t:0 "The Mafia"
  ita.1.desc:0 "For almost a century Mafia families have been around in the South and, more specifically, Sicily, from smuggling to counterfitting they seem to have their hands in almost every possible racket in Italy. Since the end of the Second World War their influence over Italy has only been growing after an era of Fascist suppression. Some people believe the Mafia is a problem, a stain on society that must be stamped out. However some others believe the Mafia can be worked with and could be used to the benefit of the government and the nation due to the significant power they already hold. The question is, how will we deal with them?"
  ita.1.a:0 "We refuse to work with criminals, organised or not"
  ita.1.b:0 "Working with them could be a benefit"
  ita.2.t:0 "Stamping them Out"
  ita.2.desc:0 "After much consideration our government has decided that the days of the Mafia and their rackets must come to an end. Already an Antimafia Commission has been created with an ultimate goal of completely stamping out any and all influence the Mafia has on Italian society. We must act fast however as it's clear that the Mafia won't go quietly and they will certainly attempt to resist and undermine any measures we try against them so government officials have devised a plan to weaken their influence, make mass arrests, end the violence and pit them against one and other to destroy any semblence of unity the families once had. However whether this will succeed or fail, only time will tell."
  ita.2.a:0 "We need to end this madness"
  ita.3.t:0 "Funding the Commission"
  ita.3.desc:0 "The Antimafia Commission was recently founded in Italian parliament in order to investigate and ultimately wipe out organised crime in Italy while measuring whether our current anti crime measures are efficient and successful. The Commission holds judicial powers in order to carry out investigations in Italy's numerous organised crime families and the Commission must also submit all reports they make on these organisations to parliament as often as desired. As it's a relatively new organisation people are skeptical on whether or not this organisation will be a success in ending the influence of the Mafia, a big debate within the government is on the issue of how much funding this commission will receive. Should we give them a large amount of funding they will certainly more easily be able to investigate organised crime due to more resources however, this would put a strain on our own government resources too."
  ita.3.a:0 "We'll give them a bit of our money"
  ita.3.b:0 "This cause deserves the utmost attention, more funding!"
  ita.4.t:0 "The Hunt is On!"
  ita.4.desc:0 "After much preparation our police force and the commission have decided to begin a campaign of identifying and subsequently investigating any and all organised crime leaders we can find. No matter the family, no matter the crimes committed we will find them and make sure they face swift and rightful justice."

Obituaries are being printed honouring the late president and Lyndon Johnson, Kennedy's Vice President, is to become the new President of the United States. Whether Johnson will be a worthy successor to Kennedy and if he has the leadership skills to lead a prosperous America shall be put to the test in these critical times."

  wotedenmark.1.t:0 "The Mona case"
  wotedenmark.1.d:0 "This morning Mona Rasmussen, just 7 years old, biked alone to her schoolbus which were to arrive at half past eleven. But as the clock turned 11:30, Mona was nowhere to be seen. Three of her classmates noticed her bike in the bushes on their way home from school, two of them ran home to their fathers to tell them the news, and soon the whole neighborhood was looking for Mona. Now three hours have passed, Mona's mother has been crying since the beginning. And with little left to comfort her with, they decided to call the cops." 
  wotedenmark.1.a:0 "You sure the cops are necessary?"
  wotedenmark.2.t:0 "The Mona case"
  wotedenmark.2.d:0 "When the cops arrived their luck werent much better than the neighborhoods, they thoroughly searched both the nearby area and the area surrounding Hvidkilde lake. The cops have now returned to their station, but Mona still hasnt been found, and as such they now request the mayors allowence to expand the operation."
  wotedenmark.2.a:0 "Keep the investigation small"
  wotedenmark.2.b:0 "Send every cop available!"
  wotedenmark.3.t:0 "The Mona case"
  wotedenmark.3.d:0 "The cops came back the day after, but again their luck was none. A few more times during the month a squad of cops quickly would sweep the area, but to no avail. The Mona case has been left open for future at-home detectives to wonder over, and what really happened to that poor girl may never be known."
  wotedenmark.3.a:0 "Maybe she'll turn up eventually?"
  wotedenmark.4.t:0 "The Mona case"
  wotedenmark.4.d:0 "Mona's corpse found in Nørresø! A total of 900 policemen and women, assisted by both helicopters and police dogs, has been searching the area around Mona's bicycle for about a month now, in what has been one of the largest search operations in danish history none of this however turned out to be enough... But, all the news about the event alongside the helicopters circling the airspace above his home made Søren, a local cyclist, look a little closer on his way to work. And he did see something suspicios; a bindle in the middle of lake Nørresø, in that bindle was Monas body sawed in two and a further post-mortem analysis of her body showed that she had been raped then later strangled... This is truly gonna haunt this nation for years..."
  wotedenmark.4.a:0 "Who would do something so horrible!"
  wotedenmark_tt: "This decision will most likely have an effect on the upcoming election. "
  wotedenmark.5.t:0 "Conservatives speak out against inaction of government"
  wotedenmark.5.d:0 "In an campaign speech earlier today, the conservative party condemned the government for inaction towards the disappearance of Mona Rasmussen. Stating that if they were to be placed in government, they would commit 'hundreds of officers' to find the girl, and make their number one priority be the safety of this nations children. We need to reestablish 'law and order' they added."
  wotedenmark.5.a:0 "Dont worry, she'll turn up any day now"
  wotedenmark.6.t:0 "Conservatives speak out against lack of law and order"
  wotedenmark.6.d:0 "'This terrible horrible tragedy, would not have happened if upholding the law was in any way a socialist priority!' those were the harsh words coming from the leader of 'Det konservative folkeparti', he continued by adding that it would be a top priority of the conservatives to 'secure the safety of this nations children'."
  wotedenmark.6.a:0 "Using this tragedy for political gain? Shameful!"
  wotedenmark.7.t:0 "The Mona case; perpetrator found!"
  wotedenmark.7.d:0 "The bindle used to store Mona Rasumessens body was made in 27,000 examples, 90 of which were sold to a local store, 10 of which were sold to a local man; 38-year old purser, father of four. The man was previously charged with sexual crimes, so it didn't take long for the police to make him prime suspect. However the man refused the crime, so the police needed definate proof. And that proof came a few days later when a piece of cloth, still drenched in an intoxicating fluid, was found near Nørresø lake, the police then found a matching piece of cloth in the house of the perpetrator and no more evidence was needed."
  wotedenmark.7.a:0 "Rot in jail bastard!"
  wotedenmark2_tt: "The mona case is now settled. "
  wotedenmark.8.t:0 "Kuwait, a sunken ship and a man named Krøyer"
  wotedenmark.8.d:0 "The ship called the 'Al Kuwait' sank just a few days ago along with some 5.000 now very dead sheep, this turns out to be a problem for the city of Kuwait. Because they get all of their drinking water from a nearby salt-water refinery, the ship as it turns out, was insured by that danish company, and as such they called up Krøyer. Karl Krøyer is something of a renaissance-man, and over the years he has invented evrything from frying pans to minerals to refrigerators. But a few hours ago when the insurance company called him they asked of him to complete what may be his biggest challenge yet; rising a sunken ship from the bottom of the persian gulf..."
  wotedenmark.8.a:0 "let's see what the egghead cooks up."
  wotedenmark.9.t:0 "Kuwait, a sunken ship and a man named Krøyer"
  wotedenmark.9.d:0 "And Krøyer had a plan within hours; simply fill up the empty hull of the ship with a few million lighter-than-water-air-filled-golfball-shaped-thingies (patent pending). Put enough of them in the hull and the boat will float, the insurance company is understandably a little sceptical, but with few other available options they greenlight the operation."
  wotedenmark.9.a:0 "That's a bold stragedy Krøyer, let's see if it pays off for you."
  wotedenmark.13.t:0 "Kuwait, a sunken ship and a man named Krøyer"
  wotedenmark.13.d:0 "The plan Worked! And while the ship pops up to the surface, a smug smile spreads across the face of Karl Krøyer. The insurance company is delighted, and Krøyer claims he will be trying to get the system patented back in Denmark."
  wotedenmark.13.a:0 "Hmmm, where have i seen this before?"
  wotedenmark.14.t:0 "Kuwait, a sunken ship and a man named 'Donald Duck'?"
  wotedenmark.14.d:0 "Well as it turns out, it may not have been a *completely* original idea. In a Donald Duck cartoonbook from 1949 'donald duck' and 'Huey, Dewey and Louie' kind of had the same problem as Krøyer, and well they kind of came up with the same solution as Krøyer. The patent office says that becouse of this, they will not be able to grant krøyer the patent he wants, as the idea had already technically been invented by Disney writer and cartoonist Carl Banks."
  wotedenmark.14.a:0 "Hahahahha, what a story!"
  wotedenmark.10.t:0 "Jens Otto Krag's new years speech - 1"
  wotedenmark.10.d:0 "I would like to say a few words about the old year - and if I can - a little about the year that has just begun.It is a good practice to begin by reminding us of those who passed away in the year that went by. I cannot name all the many within danish society whom we will surely miss when the new year's many tasks must be solved. But if I'm allowed to mention just one name, a name that has helped to create a great deal of respect for Denmark. I want to mention Niels Bohr. He has forever linked Denmark's name to one of the most fundamental breakthroughs in our physical and scientific realization; that of nuclear physics."
  wotedenmark.10.a:0 "I miss him already"
  wotedenmark.11.t:0 "Jens Otto Krag's new years speech - 2"
  wotedenmark.11.d:0 "World peace held on by a hanging hair in 1962. But that doesnt mean conflicts weren't settled. While the Congo and Katanga war continues to cause sadness, Laos was resolved. The West New Guinea problem was solved. And is it not the peace in Algeria that has really brought about the satisfaction of many, not least in our northern skies. This long-standing war, which itself contained elements of both a national liberation struggle and of racial- and civil war, the war that had taken exceptionally bloody and cruel forms. Well it's over. I also believe it is essential for the possibility of peace that there is a constant contact, dialogue and negotiation - of a diplomatically responsible nature between the two opposites of the world: the US and the Soviet, the western world and the communist. It was contacts and exchanges of views of this nature that resolved the Cuba conflict and prevented a disaster. The involvement of the Chinese troops in the border dispute with India so far from their homes has to make many wonder. And we ask ourselves: aren't these ginourmous Asian realms in such a situation that their biggest problems are within, not without, their country's borders? Wasn't it better to build schools and factories and give youth education than to raise armies and wage war? Will the newly liberated Asia repeat the old and nationalist Europe's mistakes? Will they find themselves in bloody and costly wars among themselves? Or will they, through community across borders, build something new and better?"
  wotedenmark.11.a:0 "Let us hope for a more peaceful 1963"
  wotedenmark.12.t:0 "Jens Otto Krag's new years speech - 3"
  wotedenmark.12.d:0 "However, let us look inwards for a moment - 1962 was a year of economic trouble, but it was not a bad year. Production and employment set new records. So did the construction. We finished approx. 32,000 apartments, and that record will be surpassed in the new year. But we still have a serious housing problem - not least for the young people. In the new year, the government will review the construction situation again and see what possibilities it has. Today I read in a newspaper that 1963 will be a fateful year for Denmark. Maybe it's setting things up a little dramatic. But perhaps there is something to it. Major redistribution issues need to be addressed. And everyone thinks they have something to gain. Workers, farmers, officials and employers. Only by agreeing on sensible solutions can the economy be stabilized, and the rise in prices be brought to an end. These are the deepest social demands that 1963 places on us. Let's solve them together.  Happy new years!"
  wotedenmark.12.a:0 "Gud bevare Danmark. Godt nytår!"
  wotedenmark3_tt:0 "Happy new years!"
  wotedenmark.15.t:0 "Zeitgeist København"
  wotedenmark.15.d:0 "Though København (or copenhagen) is by no means a young city, first settlements in the area are from around year 700, it has come to incompas evrything that is now defining the 1960¨s. Trams and cars fill the city streets, hippies flock around slummy concerts, and neon lights make the buildings glow in every colour once the sun sets. And whether you fancy a rollercoaster ride in Tivoli or a relaxing roundtrip of the extensive canal system; København has got you covered. This city prooves that the past and future can coexist, a city like this will most likely inspire great feats of culture in the coming years..."
  wotedenmark.15.a:0 "Jeg er forelsket i københavn"
  wotedenmark4_tt:0 "'I'm in love with copenhagen'"
  wotedenmark.16.t:0 "Election Season"
  wotedenmark.16.d:0 "The elections, set to be held no later than the 15th of november 1964, may still seem to be long way of, but already the various parties have begun discussing their programs and low intensity debates are being broadcasted on the radio. Everywhere from coffee shops to factories, discussions are turning to that of the upcoming elections. " 
  wotedenmark.17.t:0 "The danish housing crisis"
  wotedenmark.17.d:0 "Since the beginning of this century our people have moved to the cities in larger and larger numbers, but now production is not keeping up. The various old building firms have refused to build the necessary housing as they are waiting for the demand to rise even further, we need to take matters into our own hands."
  wotedenmark.17.a:0 "A home for the everyday man."
  wotedenmark5_tt:0 "A new focus tree will load"
