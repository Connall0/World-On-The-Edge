##IRAN IDEAS
PER_islamic_resistance:0 "Islamic Resistance"
PER_islamic_resistance_desc:0 "Due to the Shah's more liberal policies, many islamists, traditionalists and conservatives have begun to resist the new reforms in Iran.

## GREECE IDEAS
GRE_divided_politics:0 "Divided Politics"
GRE_divided_politics_desc:0 "Following World War 2 and the subsequent Greek Civil War, a political trichotomy developed in Greece, that of the Left-Centre-Right. Each of these groups has its own power block in an increasingly polarized parliament, with rumors swirling about the exact nature of the political structure. Greece remains sharply divided between these three groupings and nobody can effectively be a part of politics without aligning oneself to one of the power blocs. In spite of this, more extremist organizations plot a violent end to the aggressively partisan politics plaguing the Greek nation."
GRE_meddlesome_monarch:0 "Meddlesome Monarch"
GRE_meddlesome_monarch_desc:0 "The Greek constitution awards strong powers to both the monarch and the conservative elite, in a bid to combat revolutionary socialism. Because of this, Greek monarchs have routinely used their royal perogitives to either undermine or simply ignore democratic procedure and it remains to be seen whether or not Greece can effectively remain a constitutional monarchy in this time of rapid change."
GRE_disloyal_military:0 "Disloyal Military"
GRE_disloyal_military_desc:0 "The Greek military is unique in Europe in that it has a degree of independence almost unparalleled. The military has consistently resisted attempts to control it by either parliament or the monarch and the Greek government has been forced to be content with a military that is disloyal to any authority in Greece apart from itself. Furthermore, a disproportionate amount of influence in the armed forces is held by mid-ranking officers- Captains, Majors, Colonels- and these men are strongly anti-communist and will not hesitate to act if they believe their beloved Greece to be in danger."
GRE_king_paul:0 "King Paul I"

However, the king has drawn heavy criticism in recent years over his continued interference in politics."

However this new, freer Spain has it's downsides, the free market means the free exchange of ideas and this could undermine the Caudillo's authority."

##BRITISH IDEAS
ENG_declining_empire:0 "The Sun is Setting"
ENG_declining_empire_desc:0 "The sun never sets on the British Empire, or rather, the sun is setting on the British Empire. After World War 2 the British Empire began a rapid downward spiral due to exhaustion from the brutal war and lack of money due to the extremely high cost of fighting such a tough war for so long. Many of our colonies are now independent states of their own with us even losing the jewel in the crown of the empire, India. It seems the age of British dominance on the globe is at an end."
